# D2D11Collision
Very Old D2D11Collision Demo for Win 8.0

VS2013 DirectX11 2D demo for Windows 8.0 that I created back before Microsoft went rouge and started censoring conservatives. I wonder how long it will take before Microsoft takes down my GitHub account.

Anyway, I doubt this compiles anymore since I haven't looked at it in years. It used to be hosted on one of the Microsoft sites and they gave me quite a few points for it back in the Balmer days. Alas, Microsoft isn't the same company anymore. Some things are better but the censorship on MSN.com has gotten absurd.

The new Microsoft is starting to make Stallman look like an "angel". I just wish someone would stop naming GNU\Linux background drivers daemons.
